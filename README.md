# Aryan Patel — DVA-Focused Portfolio

Live Portfolio: [https://dva-portfolio.vercel.app/](https://dva-portfolio.vercel.app/)

**Full-Stack Developer & Data Visualization Analyst**

I build data-driven applications and analytics pipelines using Next.js, TypeScript, Python, and Tableau, turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights. Alongside full-stack development, I work extensively with Tableau, Google Sheets, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean, analyze, and visualize data for decision-making.

Currently pursuing B.Tech in AI at Newton School of Technology, Rishihood University (CGPA: 8.667), with hands-on experience as a QA Associate at CredoHire, where I conducted functional and UI/UX testing to enhance product performance.

With 300+ competitive programming problems solved across LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, HackerRank, and HackerEarth, I bring strong analytical thinking and problem-solving into every project.

## Portfolio Projects

### 1. Retail Profitability & Margin Optimization Dashboard

Dashboard: [Google Sheets Interactive Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eI8eT-lTITb30jTpvw0EvFOd2hQksZV_RVYjujOPWew/edit?usp=sharing)
Report: [Full Project Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1irLA_jXtsgEpZnzh0xRmhwhzpkpY8BP_tJ3v2AU9rkk/edit?usp=sharing)

An end-to-end retail analytics project analyzing ~9,800 US sales transactions to uncover patterns in profitability, regional performance, category-level margins, and shipping efficiency. The final deliverable is an interactive Excel/Sheets dashboard for business stakeholders.

The case study covers:
- Problem statement and stakeholder context
- Dataset cleaning and preprocessing (9,800 rows × 21 columns post-engineering)
- Derived feature engineering — Order Year, Order Month, Shipping Days
- Pivot-table summaries by Category, Region, Sub-Category, Ship Mode, State, and Segment
- KPI framework: $2.28M total sales across 4 US regions and 3 categories (9,802 orders)
- Dashboard screenshots and interactive link
- Key insights on regional distribution, seasonal trends, and category margins
- Actionable recommendations for margin optimization

### 2. The Unplanned Basket — Blinkit Impulse Analysis

Tableau Dashboard: [Geography of Impulse — Dashboard 2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aryan.patel8829/viz/Blinkit_Analysis_G19/Dashboard2)

An impulse-proxy scoring model across 13,000 SKUs in 10 Indian cities, quantifying what share of Blinkit's revenue is planned necessity versus unplanned convenience — and empirically pricing the premium consumers pay for small-pack, quick-delivery formats.

The case study covers:
- Problem statement: measuring the impulse layer in Blinkit's ₹509M catalogue
- Dataset: 13,000 SKUs × 25 columns, 10 cities
- End-to-end ETL pipeline — cleaning, imputation, and feature engineering
- Impulse proxy scoring model (`impulse_score` composite feature per SKU)
- KPI framework: 21.6% impulse revenue share, 6× convenience premium (small vs bulk packs)
- 5 hypothesis tests (Mann-Whitney U, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Welch t-test, Pareto analysis)
- 4-dashboard Tableau suite: Market Pulse, Where Impulse Lives, Pack Price Ladder, Geography & Promo Analysis
- 10 key insights and 5 data-backed business recommendations
